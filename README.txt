These code samples are part of some of my contract work as a senior consulting developer. They constitute bits and pieces of a SaaS eCommerce platform that was converted from WordPress to Laravel PHP and serves as an API for multiple, distinct storefronts.

A few small notes:
    - I negotiated this content disclosure with my client and have only included files that are entirely my own work
    - I have retained IP for this code as a part of my contract
    - This project was a tight-deadline "get it working" situation, and I had to take into consideration that I was working with a team with high turnover and mostly junior devs

If you would like samples of any Laravel features that do not appear here, shoot me an email and I'll whip something up for you.
