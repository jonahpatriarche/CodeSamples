These code samples are part of some of my contract work as a senior consulting developer. They constitute parts of a
SaaS eCommerce platform that was converted from WordPress to Laravel PHP and serves as an API for multiple, distinct
storefronts.

A few small notes:
    - I negotiated this content disclosure with my client and have only included files that are entirely my own work
    - I have retained IP for this code as a part of my contract
    - This project was a tight-deadline "get it working" situation, and I had to take into consideration that I was
        working with a team with high turnover and mostly junior devs

If there are any Laravel features that you are particularly interested in that do not appear in these samples, shoot me
an email and I'll whip something up for you.
